        <p>Chicken Alfredo 'dirtied up' a bit. Delicious, and anyone can make it. Kids love it, and it is a real treat. Serve with mozzarella garlic bread for an added bonus!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients you will need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16oz) Box of Fettucine</li>
            <li>1/2 pound of bacon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 (16oz) jars of Alfredo sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the fettuccini in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Finely chop bacon and set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the chicken, onion, and garlic in the butter until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in the alfredo sauce, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt; continue to cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink in the center and the sauce is heated through, about 5 minutes more. Add the chopped bacon and mix to serve.</li>
